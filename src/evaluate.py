"""Evaluation -- stratified k-fold cross-validation on the development set (week 4).

Up to week 3 the pipeline judged a model on ONE train/test split. That number depends
heavily on which rows happened to land in the test part: change the seed and it moves.
From week 4, models are judged by k-fold cross-validation instead:
  - the development set is split into k folds (stratified: each fold keeps the same
    share of reoffenders as the whole set);
  - the whole Pipeline (preprocessing + model) is fit k times, each time on k-1 folds,
    and scored on the fold it did not see;
  - we report every fold's score, their mean AND their standard deviation. The std is
    the honest "how much would this number move with different data" -- a mean alone
    hides it.

The final test set is not used anywhere in this file -- it stays locked.
See Practical/W4/notebooks/03_cross_validation.ipynb for the full walkthrough.
